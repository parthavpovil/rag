# Test Document: Machine Learning Basics

## Introduction
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: Classification, Regression

### Unsupervised Learning
- No labels provided
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through trial and error
- Used in robotics and game AI

## Conclusion
Machine learning is transforming many industries including healthcare, finance, and transportation.
