Coffee Brewing Guide

Introduction to Coffee
Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, made from roasted coffee beans. The two main species are Arabica and Robusta.

Brewing Methods

1. Pour Over
The pour-over method involves pouring hot water over coffee grounds in a filter. This method gives you control over brewing time and temperature. Ideal water temperature is 195-205°F (90-96°C).

2. French Press
French press uses coarse coffee grounds steeped in hot water for 4 minutes. After steeping, a metal mesh plunger is pressed down to separate the grounds from the coffee.

3. Espresso
Espresso is made by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee under high pressure (9 bars). A standard espresso shot is 1 ounce and takes 25-30 seconds to extract.

Coffee to Water Ratio
The golden ratio for coffee brewing is 1:16 - that means 1 gram of coffee for every 16 grams of water. For a standard cup, use about 15-18 grams of coffee.

Storage Tips
Store coffee beans in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Never store coffee in the refrigerator as it can absorb odors. Whole beans stay fresh for 2-3 weeks after roasting.

Caffeine Content
A typical 8oz cup of coffee contains 80-100mg of caffeine. Espresso has about 63mg per shot, despite its strong taste.
